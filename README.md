# Spanish Checkers #

This is a project of an online game of the spanish variant of checkers or draughts. I've made this project as part of a university project as a proof of concept for me to learn NodeJS and Socket.io. It uses the following NodeJS libraries: Socket.io, Express, Body-parser.

An old not-ideal, yet fun to play little side-project/university assignment. It is lacking some features, and may contain unexpected features (ie bugs). Most probably will never fix any of that.

The game can be played online at [checkers.yaroslavps.com](http://checkers.yaroslavps.com).
