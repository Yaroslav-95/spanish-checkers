# Spanish Checkers

This is a project of an online game of the spanish variant of checkers or
draughts. I've made this project as part of a university project as a proof of
concept for me to learn NodeJS and Socket.io. It uses the following NodeJS
libraries: Socket.io, Express, Body-parser.

An old not-ideal, yet fun to play little side-project/university assignment. It
is lacking some features, and may contain unexpected features (ie bugs). Most
probably will never fix any of that.

The game was available to play online at
[checkers.yaroslavps.com](http://checkers.yaroslavps.com).

I don't really plan on updating this project, so it's just getting archived for
posterity.
